//@ function Calculates mean and standard deviation of a unidimentional time-series. For more information about Bessel correction, visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel's_correction . As a thumb rule, if you have ALL the population in your time-series, set bessel_correction = 0, other ways, if you have a sample of the population, set bessel_correction = 1.

//@ function The Gait ratio represents how many steps do you achieve with a given cadence (step frequency).

//@ function Menz et al (2008) says that if the fourier transformation of a gait signal is calculated, the even components will contain the "power" used to produce the motion, while the odd components represents the irregularities in the gait pattern. The ratio between even and odd components could then describe the regularity of gait motion.

//@ function Makes a T-test for two population samples, i.e test how likely is that the mean value of both samples is the same. The result is only meaningful if both populations has the same variance, other ways, you should use a Welch test. Returns the p-value of the test.
